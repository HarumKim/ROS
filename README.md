# 🤖 CoppeliaSim Projects with ROS2 (Using WSL)

Welcome to this collection of **CoppeliaSim simulation projects** integrated with **ROS2**, developed in a **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)** environment. These projects were created as part of a robotics course and are focused on simulating and controlling a **differential robot** performing tasks such as trajectory following, object detection, and PID control.

## 🚀 How to Run the Projects

1. **Clone the repository** in your Linux (WSL) environment:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HarumKim/coppeliasim-ros2.git
   
1. **Launch CoppeliaSim** from your Linux environment and load the desired scene.
   
3. **Execute** the ROS2 launch file corresponding to the project:
   ```bash
   ros2 launch <package_name> <launch_file_name>.launch.py

4. Start the simulation in CoppeliaSim to begin interaction

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
🧠 ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2) – Communication and control framework

🎮 CoppeliaSim – 3D simulation environment

🐧 WSL – Linux-based development environment

⚙️ Differential Drive Robot Model – Simulated robot platform

🎯 PID Controllers – For trajectory and orientation correction

👁️ Vision Sensors – Used for object/color detection

## Example
Here is an example of a simulation running in CoppeliaSim with ROS2:
