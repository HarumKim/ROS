CoppeliaSim Projects with ROS2 (Using WSL)

This repository contains various simulation projects created in CoppeliaSim using ROS2 within a WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) environment. These projects were developed as part of a robotics course and focus on simulating and controlling a differential robot.

To run the projects:
-- Clone this repository in your Linux (WSL) environment.
-- Open CoppeliaSim from Linux and load the corresponding scene.
-- Run the appropriate .launch.py file using ROS2.
-- Start the simulation in CoppeliaSim.

Each project includes its own README with specific details and instructions
